# Inventory Management System

## Project Proposal

### Project Title
Inventory Management System for a Small Store

### Project Description
The goal is to develop a simple and efficient inventory management system for a small store. This system will allow users to add, delete, and search for items while storing essential details such as quantity and price. By leveraging fast and organized data management, the system aims to improve efficiency and minimize manual errors.

## Key Components

### Data Structures and Algorithms

#### Hash Maps
- Purpose: Store and retrieve item details (e.g., name, quantity, price) quickly using a unique identifier (e.g., item code).
- Advantages: Provides average time complexity of O(1) for search, insert, and delete operations.

#### Sorting Algorithms
- Purpose: Organize inventory items by attributes such as name, price, or quantity.
- Implementation: Utilize algorithms like quicksort or merge sort for optimal sorting performance.

- Prevent duplication of item identifiers.

### 2. Delete Item
- Remove an item from the inventory using its unique identifier.
- Ensure the inventory list is updated to reflect the changes.

### 3. Search Item
- Search for an item by:
  - Unique identifier
  - Name
- Display the item's details, including:
  - Quantity
  - Price

### 4. Organize Items
- Provide options to sort items by:
  - Name
  - Price
  - Quantity
- Enable better visualization and inventory management.
