# Hospital Queue System

## Project Proposal
> This project aims to address common challenges in hospitals, such as long waiting times and inefficient patient tracking, by implementing a dynamic priority-based queue system. The system ensures that patients with critical conditions are attended to first, improving hospital efficiency and patient care.

## Functionalities
- Log in as admin
- View "in line" and "attending to" patients in display mode
